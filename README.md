Static Sporadic Server in Real-Time Systems Using Allegro Library

Overview
This project implements a Static Sporadic Server (SSS) for real-time systems using the Allegro library. The goal is to efficiently schedule periodic and sporadic tasks while maintaining system responsiveness.

Objectives
Develop a scheduling algorithm to manage periodic and sporadic tasks.
Optimize CPU utilization and resource allocation.
Analyze and visualize SSS performance under different scenarios.
Key Components
Static Sporadic Server
A dedicated server that handles sporadic tasks with a fixed capacity, ensuring timely execution without interfering with periodic tasks.

Task Model
Define and simulate task behavior using periodic and sporadic tasks characterized by execution time, period, and deadlines.

Scheduling Algorithm
Implement scheduling mechanisms such as Rate Monotonic or Earliest Deadline First to:

Prioritize tasks efficiently.
Manage task overruns and missed deadlines.
Simulation and Visualization
Use Allegro's graphics features to:

Simulate task scheduling and CPU usage.
Visualize response times, task execution, and resource utilization.
Implementation Steps
Define task parameters, including execution times, periods, and deadlines.
Implement the Static Sporadic Server logic using Allegro.
Set up the simulation environment with Allegro's graphics and timing functions.
Collect performance data on CPU usage, task execution times, and deadlines met.
Analyze results and prepare documentation with insights and findings.
Expected Outcomes
A functional prototype of the Static Sporadic Server integrated into a real-time system.
Detailed performance analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of SSS.
Visualizations to illustrate task scheduling, CPU utilization, and system responsiveness.
